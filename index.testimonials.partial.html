            <p class="testimonial__text">I found this school of capoeira by chance when I was looking for some kind of physical activity for myself. I was impressed not only by capoeira itself but also by the way it is taught here. I have been training at this school for three years already.</p>

            <p class="testimonial__text">I had had capoeira experience before moving to Dubai, so the first thing I did was to look for a school. I was lucky to enroll in the Advanced course here. I have not seen such a level of teaching before. In addition, the schedule is very convenient and the price is good.</p>

            <p class="testimonial__text">Itâ€™s not so easy to find a suitable sport for a girl. Friends advised me to enroll my daughter in this school of capoeira. Stacey was completely delighted. This school has wonderful trainers, classes are filled with music, talking, games. And technical drills, of course. </p>
